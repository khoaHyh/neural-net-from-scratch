# Neural Network from Scratch - Part 3: Matrix Operations & Complete Network

In part 3, I'll be improving the model by adding matrix multiplication and overall making the neural network more mature.

## Prep

### Learning Objectives

- **Understand how matrix operations work in neural networks** - how do matrices enable batch processing and how are they efficient?
- **Understand vectorization** - what is the difference between processing one example at a time vs processing batches?
- **Numpy broadcasting** - crucial for implementing matrix operations efficiently
