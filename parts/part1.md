# Project Setup & Linear Model

## Setup

1. Create a new Python project directory
2. Set up a virtual environment
3. Install basic dependencies: numpy and matplotlib

## First Component: A Simple Linear Model
The most basic neural model is just a linear function: `y = wx + b`

### Your Task:

- Create a file part1_linear_model.py
- Generate some simple data (e.g., points on a line with some noise)
- Implement functions for:
    - Initializing parameters (`w` and `b`)
    - Forward pass (calculating prediction)
    - Calculating loss (mean squared error)
    - Manually update parameters

### Questions to explore:

- What happens if you change the initial weights?
- How would you calculate the error/loss?
- Can you visualize your data and predictions?
